# License-Plate-Detection
This project implements a license plate detection system using a custom object detection pipeline with **Faster R-CNN** and a **MobileNet V2 backbone** with **Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)** in **PyTorch**. The training data is sourced from **Roboflow Universe**, and the model is trained to accurately detect license plates in images.
